            Sanganeri prints are believed to have been around for more than<br />five centuries. They gained immense
            popularity during the 16th<br />and 17th century when the East India Company began exporting<br />them to
            European countries due to the widespread popularity<br />for its trademark dyes and designs.<br />The
            characteristic trait of Sanganeri hand block print is that it<br /><br />uses a pure white base fabric on
            which delicate and detailed flo-<br />ral trellis patterns are printed. Sanganeri prints are famous for<br /><br />Calico
            prints, recognised by their dual colour prints done repeat-<br />edly in diagonal rows and Doo Rookhi
            prints, that come on both<br /><br />sides of the fabric. (Sundari Silks, 2021)<br />Each motif is brought
            to life through a unique interplay of fine<br />craftsmanship and rich colours. The artisans of Sanganer
            employ<br />a special technique where the outlines are first printed, then<br />filled in and repeated in
            diagonal sections. The finer lines and<br />subdued colours make it remarkable and revered. (Sundari
            Silks,<br />2021) This laborious, detailed process makes each product not<br />only exceptional, but also a
            coveted collectible.

            <p class="the-heart-of-jaipur playfairdisplay-normal-viridian-16px">
              The heart of Jaipur lies in its flamboyant ways, from its bustling bazaars,<br />royal palaces and forts
              to its colourful streets, picturesque countryside<br />and vibrant artisan communities. The city boasts of
              various regions, each<br />of which has something unique to offer.<br />Situated approximately 16
              kilometres south of Jaipur, Sanganer is one<br />such region.It is a riot of colour, a small town bustling
              with creativity. As<br />a creative and artistic hub, the region boasts of a unique design language<br />that
              is reflected through its famous Jain temples, handmade paper industry and most importantly, its unique
              hand block print industry which has been around for more than five centuries.<br />Sanganeri hand block
              printed textile products are protected as a geographical indication under Geographical Indication of Goods
              (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999. It was granted the GI tag in 2010. The GI<br />certificate has
              not only recognised the uniqueness and distinct identity of Sanganeri hand block prints in dress material,
              but also in related products<br />such as home furnishing manufactured in the traditional manner by the<br />community
              of Chhipas. (F2F, 2010)

            <p class="it-is-believed-that playfairdisplay-normal-irish-coffee-16px">
              It is believed that the artisans, who belong to the Chhippa community, draw lineage from the artisans of
              Kathiawar in Gujarat, and historical records also support their Gujarat connection. <br />
              The social upheavals that occurred during the wars of the Mughals and the Marathas in the mid 17th
              century, followed by incursions of ideas between Gujarat and Rajasthan fostered aesthetic similarities in
              their craft. <br />Selected for its abundance of soft water and clay suitable for the process of sun
              bleaching fabrics, Sanganer was developed into a major printing centre under the patronage of the Jaipur
              royal family. <br />It is possible that Sawai Jai Singh (1700-44), who founded the city of Jaipur in 1727
              A.D. and promoted various crafts in his kingdom, contributed to the growth of textile printing in Sanganer
              during the early 18th century. (Jasminder Kaur, 2017)

              <p class="body playfairdisplay-medium-viridian-16px">
                From all the experiences and knowledge, all the artisans have concluded mutual<br />interests and facts
                about the current status of the craft in India. They need all the<br />support and enthusiasm from
                people to help them keep the craft alive because the<br />government helps the artisans with the way of
                The Artisan Card only, they do not get<br />any other help from the government.<br /><br />Since the
                exhibition places around India are closed and they are not getting any employment around they expect the
                government to be cooperative. Artisans believe<br />that Sanganeri Art has a good market at the moment,
                though everything is unpredictable but they are confident that the art won’t die anytime soon. They are
                getting<br /><br />good amount of work as well as labour requirements, people are getting paid and<br />have
                a stable living. Screen Printing needs full production from them, block printing<br />is also going well
                they take orders from 5M and above!

                    parallel running<br />strips in an interlace manner. (Jasminder Kaur, 2017)<br />Along with flowers
                    and leaves, bhants of peacock, parrots and other<br />birds were also seen. Some common traditional

                    Jaal is a composition of natural motifs that creates a floral design all<br />over. These Bhants are
                    meticulously arranged to make patterns that<br />look like an intricate Jaal (net). Earlier, motifs
                    inspired from flora were<br />seen but later on birds and animals were also used for these
                    designs.<br />Some of the traditional Sanganeri Jaal are Keri jaal (mango), Gulab<br />jaal (rose),
                    Patti jaal (leaves), Hiran jaal (deer) and Sher jaal (lion).

                    A distinction can be seen in the bhants used by<br />the chhippas. Local and temple textiles
                    featured indigenous flora whereas fabrics destined for royalty often portrayed flowers from foreign
                    lands.
